# Windows Community Toolkit Labs - Experiment project template

This directory includes the template for creating new labs experiments.

## dotnet new

To use the template to create a new experiment, open a command prompt in the root directory and run the following commands:

```ascii
dotnet new --install .\template\

cd labs

dotnet new labsapp -n MyExperimentNameHere
```

This creates a new experiment called "MyExperimentNameHere".
You can now open `./labs/MyExperimentNameHere/MyExperimentNameHere.sln` and create something amazing!
