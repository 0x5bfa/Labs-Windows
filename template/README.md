# Windows Community Toolkit Labs - Experiment project template

This directory includes the template for creating new labs experiments.

## dotnet new

To use the template to create a new experiment, open a command prompt in the root directory and run the following commands:

```ascii
dotnet new --install .\template\

cd labs

dotnet new labsapp -n MyLabsApp
```

This will have created a new experiment called "MyLabsApp".
You can now open `./labs/MyLabsApp/MyLabsApp.sln` and create something amazing!
